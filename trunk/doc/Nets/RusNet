RusNet IRC network is serving Russian community all throughout the
world but mostly in Russia and Ukraine. According to the network specifics 
numerous add-ons and extensions to original IRC daemon have been made. Some
features might be found useful in other irc networks. Some of our code may
appear in future releases of the original IRC daemon,
but there will always be the "national" code.
