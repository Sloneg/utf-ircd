uk_UA		translit capable locale for iconv operations on Linux.
		To use it instead your system locale simply import locale
		to your /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive using the following
		command:

localedef --replace -i uk_UA

		If you have no superuser privileges, add --with-locpath to
		configure options, so that it creates custom locale path
		and points ircd to read locale data from there.
