The rusnet-ircd team is a group of ircd coders who were sick and tired
of the limitations, instability and lack of multi-language support
of the ircd daemon available. 

Rusnet-ircd stands for the classic ircd branch with advanced character sets
support, many optimizations and new features implemented by rusnet team coders.
 
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this effort.
