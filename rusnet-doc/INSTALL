Thanks for opening this one.

To configure your rusnet-1.5 server please do the following steps
after unpacking:

1. Read rusnet-doc/RUSNET_DOC and rusnet-doc/RELEASE_NOTES carefully.
2. configure, tune config.h, make server and make install-server. If something
   goes wrong, read rusnet-doc/BUGS as well.
3. cd to server's directory (/usr/local/rusnet by default).
4. Inspect etc/example.* and create etc/ircd.conf (and etc/rusnet.conf
   when you don't use unicode support, edit "prefix" string there, it must
   match server's codepages directory).
5. Check these files permissions. The ircd must have read/write permissions for
   kills.conf and read permissions for the rest.
   Also ircd must have write permissions to etc/ directory (create/delete files).
   Check if you have #include kills.conf line in your ircd.conf file.
6. If you want SSL, run support/ssl_cert script and answer all questions.
   Put the files it generated into the directory where your ircd.conf resides.
7. Again, read RUSNET_DOC if you are not familiar with how to configure
   SSL, auto-connections, dynamic Klines, logging, UTF support or other 
   special features.

Never run ircd compiled with #define DEBUGMODE in production.
Never change the settings in config.h that are not required to change.
Do not change MAXCONNECTIONS to the value that your server will never be close to,
because ircd reserves all its static buffers according to this value.

So far so good. If you're reading this line you should be okay.

Adel, erra.
